By using tmux, we can work in background: even when the local session is exited or inactive, the process will still alive in the tmux session.
```termiinal
sudo apt-get install tmux
```

## command about session
Shows the list of tmux sessions: ```tmux ls```

Get into a tmux session "NAME": ```tmux a -t NAME```

Create new session "NAME": ```tmux new -s NAME```

Get out of the session: ```tmux detach``` or just close the window

## command mode <ctrl + b>
You can switch to command mode that can change some settings.
The followings are must be done after pressing ctrl + b.

```%```: split vertically

```"```: split horizontally

```:set synchronize```: (toggle. you may add ' on' or ' off') type the same input for whole pane in a window

```:setw mouse -g on```: allow using mouse (scroll, drag pane splitting line)

## copy and paste
The same as the terminal but, have to press Shift key

i.e., Shift + (drag a sentence or double click a word) will copy the block

i.e., Shift + (right click) will paste copied text.
